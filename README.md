# GAPIC Generator for Dart

This is the placeholder README file for the Dart Google API client library
generator.

The generator takes annotated protocol buffer files from
[googleapis/googleapis](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis)
as an input and generates Dart client libraries supporting special features
such as timeouts, retries, long running operations, paging, and streaming.
